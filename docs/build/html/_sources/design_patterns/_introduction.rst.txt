Design Patterns
========================================

**In software engineering, a design pattern is a recommended solution
to a software design problem.**

Here we developed these design Patterns in practice, so we can use them 
in our own applications. Each design pattern is a class that you can 
inherit from; enabling your own classes to have that specific capability.

.. warning::
    Using a design pattern may have consequences that you must be aware of.
    Please don't use codes in this section unless you totally understand the behaviour
    of the design pattern in question.
